"""
Simulates a cartâ€“pole inverted pendulum system.

The physical model is specified in `mjcf/inverted_pendulum/robot.xml` and
consists of:
 - A cart that can slide horizontally along a track.
 - A pendulum pole hinged to the top of the cart.

It is composed of 1 actuator:
 - A linear motor actuator that applies a horizontal force to the cart via its
   slide joint.

The robot is controlled by a policy function that takes the current state and
returns the desired action. An action in this case is a NumPy array of shape
(1,) representing the commanded motor input for the cart:

    action[0] = horizontal force applied to the cart (in Newtons if the MJCF
                specifies `gear="1"` on the motor)

Positive values push the cart in the +x direction; negative values push it in
the -x direction. Moving the cart causes the attached pole to accelerate and
can be used to balance it upright or swing it up from a hanging position.
